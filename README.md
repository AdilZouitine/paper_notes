The idea is inspired by [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes) who inspired himself by [Adrian Colyer](https://blog.acolyer.org/about/) and [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).

----

This repository will contain notes from the research papers I have read.
The papers will be sorted by domain and date.
Finally, each paper will be accompanied by a note on my understanding level, the scale will be between 0 and 10.

I will update it over time and through my readings.

**As a beginner, don't hesitate to correct me** :smile:
