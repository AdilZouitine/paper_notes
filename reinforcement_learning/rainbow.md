# [Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf)


Understanding note : **6**

**TLDR** :

- Several independent improvements of Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm.
- This paper proposes an agent that combined some improvement of DQN algorithm
- Provide state-of-art performance on the Atari 2600 Benchmark

**Key points** :

- Rainbow is a combination of **6** independent improvement.
- Double Q-Learning
- Prioritized replay
- Dueling networks
- Multi-step learning
- Distributional RL
- Noisy net
- Rainbow variants prioritize transitions by the Kullbackâ€“Leibler loss
- Prioritized replay and multi-step learning are the most crucial components of Rainbow
- Rainbow improve the learning speed
